            <p>
                I made this website to hopefully give universities an incentive to change their website's design and structure.
                I am currently applying to universities in the US and I get frustrated and overwhelmed by some university websites
                because they don't have clear information about their fees structure, their events, or their courses. What makes it
                worse is that these universities ask you to write large essays about them, and because of this difficulty of finding
                info about a university from THEIR OWN website, students resort to using tools like chatgpt or going through pages
                upon pages of google results just to find a bit of info.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is that universities be encouraged to change their website (the bad parts of their website) in an attempt
                to stay off this website. Maybe the chances of them doing this are less, at least in the early stages, but if this
                website becomes as big as other websites that rank universities based off of other real factors then maybe the
                universities will make an effort. In the long run, this will make it much easier for future students applying to
                universities to find more information easier. For now, I want to allow the community (students that are applying
                to university) to shape the list.
